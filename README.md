# Java-App-Plane-Tickets

Java application for flight reservations and ticket management featuring GUI interfaces using 'JFrame' objects.

The Singleton design pattern is used, designed to have a single instance throughout the application's lifecycle. This ensures there's a single point of access to flight data, preventing multiple conflicting instances.

For the project to run, open project folder in an IDE, like VSCode and run the file PlaneTickets.java.
